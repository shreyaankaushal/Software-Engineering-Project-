A learning(reinforcement) algorithm for agro and domestic plant growth assistance 

Agro and Domestic Foliage Growth Assistance Algorithm 

Kitchen gardens and isolated farming clusters suffer most from lack of knowledge about good agricultural and domestic gardening practices. Through our project, we aim to reduce this deficit of knowledge and simulate an agro consult through an intelligent algorithm. 
The basic factors observable by the agricultural or domestic user which affect the growth of a plant/tree/crop are as follows – 
•	Light – The day for light intensity (solar) is available for most areas.
•	Temperature - The temperature of an area dictates which species of foliage flourishes and which doesn’t.
•	Water/Humidity/Moisture – Ground water levels, quality of irrigation , moisture, humidity and relative humidity are comprehensive quantifiable measures for judging plant growth.
•	Nutrition – This will also take into account anthropogenic and natural factors that affect the quality of nutrients that the plant in question receives 
•	Foliage Absorption – effective radiant sunlight reaching and being absorbed by the subject plant
•	Soil quality – The fertility of soil and the underlying structure greatly affects growth, life span and yield

There are also other things which do not directly affect the subject plant but do factor in. The are mentioned below –
•	Surrounding foliage
•	Skill of farmer/domestic end user 
•	Seasonal calendar 
•	Unforeseen meteorological occurrences  

The core idea of this project is to convert every one of these factors into a quantifiable value or score which would act as parameters and then assign these parameters weights according to the subject crop. These weighted parameters then become inputs to our intelligent algorithm. The main features that we hope to include in the algorithm are –
•	Dynamic Suggestion- based on periodic inputs from user(simplified , no quantified)
•	Learning – The algorithm learns over times and decides good moves and bad moves (checkers model)
•	AI based decision making on objective action like to give or not to give more water.
